# Signals-Angular16

##A signal is a wrapper around a value that can notify interested consumers when that value changes. Signals can contain any value, from simple primitives to complex data structures.

##A computed signal derives its value from other signals. Define one using computed and specifying a derivation function:Computed signals are not writable signals

##Signals are useful because they can notify interested consumers when they change. An effect is an operation that runs whenever one or more signal values change. You can create an effect with the effect function:
